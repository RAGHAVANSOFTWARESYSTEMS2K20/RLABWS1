#A company has two grades of inspector 1 and 2, who are to be assigned for a
#uality control inspection. It is required that at least 2,000 pieces be inspected per
#8 â€“ hour day. Grade 1 inspector can check pieces at the rate of 40 with an
#accuracy of 97 %. Grade 2 inspector checks at the rate of 30 pieces per hour with
#an accuracy of 95 %. The wage rate of a Grade 1 inspector is Rs.5 per hour while
#that of a Grade 2 inspector is Rs.4 per hour. An error made by an inspector costs
#Rs.3 to the company. There are only nine Grade 1 inspectors and eleven Grade 2
#inspectors available in the company. The company wishes to assign work to the
#available inspectors so as to minimize the daily inspection cost.
